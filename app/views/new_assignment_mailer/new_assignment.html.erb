Howdy all --

Sending you our standard 'overview' email for engagements we do with clients. This is more the who's who and engagement overview. You have received (or will receive) a separate document from Dorothy that outlines the mechanics of tracking time etc.

Thanks again for joining us for the PLM project! All of us at Rocket are really excited to get a chance to work with you on this project.

<strong>Where/when should I work?</strong>
For this project, your work will be done both on and offsite. The expectation is that you will be in the office 2 days a week. Specific days TBD based upon your schedule and PLMs. Historically we have done M,W.

A huge THANK YOU  for being flexible and spending sometime onsite with them.

There are several other Rocket folks currently at PLM... more on this below but we currently go into PLM's office on Monday and Wednesday.

You are starting the following Monday, 8/27. The will initially be a 3 month engagement but it is likely it will extend assuming everyone is happy.

Do note that you will need to use a PLM computer for this engagement. On your first day they will give you a nice, new, fast Mac. This is for security reasons @ PLM since you will have access to sensitive data.

Am I going to be positioned as a Rocket team member. Do I get an email?
Yes. :) We are giving you a Rocket email. Please use this for all project correspondence. If anyone asks directly you can just tell them this is your first engagement with Rocket and we met via mutual colleagues.

Who's working on the project?

There are a bunch of Rocket folks currently at PLM. Here are the folks.... these people are NOT on your team. More on that below.
Brian Manning (Android dev)
Richard Reece (Android dev)
Matt Daigle (iOS dev)
Thariq Shihipar (Rails dev)
Dan Matiaudes (Designer)
Ariel Simon (Designer)

You are joining one of the Rails team. Brittany St. Germain is the engineering manager for this team. I don't know too much about this. What we do know is that they have an existing PLM team and a big backlog of groomed work. They are simply looking for an experienced dev to come in and be able to plug right into the team. From the Rails work we have done with them they have good engineering hygiene (CI, Rails 5 etc.). I will share more details as I learn them.

You are joining a team with one other Rocket person on it -- Libby. Will intro you when you are on slack.

In terms of folks at PLM that you might run into...
Matt Gay: Engineering mgr for all mobile teams (native and now RN)
Brittany St. Germain, Director of engineering for lots of the Rails teams
Doug Martilla, VP Engineering.... Matt/Brittany report to him

What do I need to know
We have been working with PatientsLikeMe for about a year so far. We initially joined them to help build their Android app (Brian and Richard). They recently expanded to add Matt Daigle (iOS). Then Rails.

They recently landed a big round of funding and are *greatly* expanding their team and a lot more Rocket folks.

They are an easy going team that has solid engineering practices. They have a good process and are great to work with.

They are security conscious because they have patient data. You will likely go through security training and use a PLM provided laptop.

The ex-CTO of PLM is working with us (Jeff Cole) on a different project  (Bose, doing iOS dev).

There is a plm-internal channel in Slack but I see you are already in there. :)

What are the time tracking requirements?
You are expected to track all your time weekly in Harvest. Not sure what you guys use but Harvest is the least painful system we’ve found. The Harvest app is pretty damn good. We use Harvest for invoicing and paying you, so you’ll want to make sure it’s right. If you don’t mind adding just a couple of bullet points for a given day of what was worked on that would be dandy. It helps keep our clients happy. E.g., “Fixed the browsing to drill into collections, integrated the API into various parts of the settings, integrated crashlytics and build buddy”

What other tools are we using?

We use Slack for team communication. Once you access your Rocket email, please join us here: https://rocketinsights.slack.com
GitHub for source control. Doug/PLM/Brittany will add you.

What if I get stuck or have questions?
Contact the Exec Sponsor, Ashley Streb.
